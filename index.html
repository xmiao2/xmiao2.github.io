<p>Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

<p>My name is Xiaohang Miao, but if that give you trouble (as it does for many), I'd also prefer to go by <b>James</b>.</p>

<p>I am currently a senior undergraduate student at North Carolina State University majoring in <b>Computer Science</b>.</p>

<p>My <b>passion</b> is to use technology to make lives easier.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to be able to find a wide variety of internship positions during my undergrad career. At <u>Amazon</u>, I was a Software Engineer who worked to improve performance on low level kindle reader platforms. At <u>IBM</u>, I was a dedicated Front-End Web Developer who used javascript to create components in enterprise web applications. At <u>Kadro Solutions</u>, I was a Full-Stack Web Developer who used a great amount of tool sets to provide support for customer's e-commerce needs.</p>

<p>As you can see, I am a jack-of-all-trades, but not necessarily master-of-none.</p>

<p>I have 2+ years of professional experience with the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java 8</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, LESS, Javascript, jQuery</li>
  <li>SQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server</li>
  <li>Git, Regex</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also been exposed with these following technologies at work, school or during free developement time (those are things that I don't usually put on my resume):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C/C++, C#, Python, Ruby</li>
  <li>JSP, Spring MVC, Rails, Django, Node, Express, Angular, Meteor</li>
  <li>MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL</li>
  <li>Data Analysis, NLP, Android SDK</li>
</ul>
