<h2>Hey there!</h2> 

<p>Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>

<p>My name is Xiaohang Miao, but if that give you trouble (as it does for many), I'd also prefer to go by <i>James</i>.</p>

<p>I am currently a senior undergraduate student at North Carolina State University majoring in Computer Science.</p>
<br/>

<b>My Passion</b>
<hr/><br/>
Use technology to make lives easier.</p>
<br/>

<b>My Strength</b>
<hr/><br/>
<p>I consider myself hard working and always aim to achieve the highest standard. I am also result-oriented and would act quickly to get my goals delivered, or on track to be delivered.</p>

<br/>

<b>My Experience</b>
<hr/><br/>
<p>I was fortunate to be able to find a wide variety of internship positions during my undergrad career. At <u>Amazon</u>, I was a Software Engineer who worked to improve performance on low level kindle reader platforms. At <u>IBM</u>, I was a dedicated Front-End Web Developer who used javascript to create components in enterprise web applications. At <u>Kadro Solutions</u>, I was a Full-Stack Web Developer who used a great amount of tool sets to provide support for customers' e-commerce needs.</p>
<p>As you can see, I am a jack-of-all-trades, but not necessarily master-of-none.</p>

<p>I have 2+ years of professional experience with the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java 8</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, LESS, Javascript, jQuery</li>
  <li>SQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server</li>
  <li>Git, Regex</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also been exposed with these following technologies at work, school or during free developement time (those are things that I don't usually put on my resume):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C/C++, C#, Python, Ruby</li>
  <li>JSP, Spring MVC, Rails, Django, Node, Express, Angular, Meteor</li>
  <li>MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL</li>
  <li>Data Analysis, NLP, Android SDK</li>
</ul>
