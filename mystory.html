<p>Working in the field of software engineering has been a decision I made since I was 14. At the time, I had just migrated to America from China. I couldn't speak any English and didn't have any friends to play with. Fortunately, I befriended the kitchen computer and was facinated by a software called Game Maker. It was a game engine that allows users to create simple games with drag-and drop controls. Although, after a while, I quickly grew tired of my rudimentary creations. For example, I aspired to have my dragon shoot 100 fireballs with one powerup; however, I did not have the patience nor desire to drag 100 spirtes onto the canvas.
Fortunately, there are scripting features in Game Maker, and soon, I discovered the magic of array and loops. Like a deer thirsty for water, the 14 year old me borrowed many library books on programming and attempted to teach myself. From then on, I never looked back at any other career possibilities.</p>
<p>I am now a senior in university and had almost 2 years of professional experience in full stack web development. My favorite language is Javascript, and my most dominant language is Java. During my internship at Amazon, I will be working with Wordwise on Kindle to develop features that helps people read books in Chinese. In my spare time, I enjoy basketball, video games, swimming and playing guitar.</p>
